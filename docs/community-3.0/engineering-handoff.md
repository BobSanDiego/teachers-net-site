# Community 3.0 Engineering Handoff

## 1. Current Phase

Maintenance — completed teacher-group identity correction.

## 2. Current Ticket

None. The corrective milestone is closed; do not begin a new feature from this
handoff.

## 3. Last Completed Milestone

Teacher-group operations were corrected to resolve the canonical group through
`tnet_local_data.local_path -> tnet_groups.local_path ->
tnet_groups.group_id`. The hidden legacy assumption that `path_id` and
`group_id` are interchangeable is no longer used for membership operations.

The correction covered global group state, chatboard modal/settings reads,
group-join mail-frequency lookup, Chat Center member counts, header star,
sidebar membership/count/avatar presentation, and temporary diagnostic cleanup.

## 4. Verification Record

The completed work was reported verified for join, leave, reload persistence,
header and sidebar membership state, member counts, avatars, group settings,
email-frequency persistence, Chat Center counts, the divergent AI in Education
board, and a legacy board control.

## 5. Architectural Caution

`path_id` remains the chatboard/post/feed identity. It must not be used as a
teacher-group or membership identity without an explicit mapping to the
canonical `tnet_groups.group_id`. Downstream templates should prefer the
canonical preloaded group state and retain only bounded fallbacks for partial
legacy execution paths.

## 6. Process Lessons

- Debug from returned server state rather than inferring from a stalled UI.
- Resolve the shared identity assumption instead of treating each symptom as a
  separate defect.
- Compare a divergent record with a legacy control record.
- Remove temporary HTML, logging, comments, and dump/exit diagnostics before
  milestone closure.
